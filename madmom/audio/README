This package includes audio handling functionality and low-level features.
The definition of "low" may vary, but all "high" level features (e.g. beats,
onsets, etc.) should be put into madmom.features.*.

Almost all functionality blocks are split into two classes:
A) a data class: instances are signal dependent, i.e. they operate directly on
   the signal and show different values for different signals.
B) a processor class: for every data class there should be a processor class
   with the exact same name and a "Processor" suffix. This class must inherit
   from madmom.Processor or madmom.SequentialProcessor and define a process()
   method which returns a data class.

The data classes should be indexable/iterable, i.e. they can be used as a
direct replacement for numpy arrays. This design choice was made to allow both
the data as well as the processor classes to operate either on numpy arrays or
instances of data classes interchangeably.
