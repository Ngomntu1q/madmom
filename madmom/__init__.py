This package is used internally by the Department of Computational Perception,
Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria (http://www.cp.jku.at) and the
Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (OFAI), Vienna, Austria
(http://www.ofai.at).

All features should be implemented as classes which inherit from Processor
(or provide a XYProcessor(Processor) variant). This way, multiple Processor
objects can be chained to achieve the wanted functionality.

Please see the README for further details of this module.
