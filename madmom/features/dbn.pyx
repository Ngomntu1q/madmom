    Transition model class for a DBN.

    The transition model is defined similar to a scipy compressed sparse row
    matrix and holds all transition log probabilities from one state to an

    All state indices for row state s are stored in
    states[pointers[s]:pointers[s+1]]
    and their corresponding log probabilities are stored in
    log_probabilities[pointers[s]:pointers[s+1]].

    This allows for a parallel computation of the viterbi path.

    being sub-classed to define a new transition model.
