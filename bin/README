This folder contains executable scripts, which make use of all the nice things
included in this package. Most of them can be run in single file mode:

bin/name_of_script.py single INFILE [OUTFILE]

or in batch mode:

bin/name_of_script.py batch LIST OF INFILES

There should be an `--help` option which describes all the other options.
Please note that both the script and the single/batch mode have their own help
messages, i.e. `bin/name_of_script.py -h` and `bin/name_of_script.py single -h`
show different help messages with options for the algorithm itself or for the
operation mode (single/batch).

The scripts should be considered as examples of usage, which can change without
prior notice. Do NOT rely on any feature output of these scripts! If you need
stable features, create a branch and set all parameters accordingly.
Alternatively you can use the `--pickle` mode to pickle any Processors/scripts
to be able to reproduce results with the very same setting of parameters.
Please be aware that the software modules must be exactly the same, thus it is
advisable to to this in a branch as well or rely on a commit (or at least on a
version tag) of the software.

Since some of the scripts are used directly for the annual MIREX evaluation,
tagged branches reflecting the settings of these submitted algorithms should be
created. 

If you get segfaults on Mac OS X systems, please check if numpy and scipy use
ATLAS instead of Apple's own Accelerate framework or use the '-j 1' switch.
