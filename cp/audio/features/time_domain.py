    Sound pressure level (SPL) or sound level is a logarithmic measure of the
    effective sound pressure of a sound relative to a reference value.
    It is measured in decibels (dB) above a standard reference level.

    :Parameters:
      - `signal`: Audio data (np.array, list, ...)
      - `p_ref`: Reference level. If microphone is not calibrated, use 1.0

        Sound pressure level of the passed audio signal in dB
